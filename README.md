## My Previous Coding Experience
I have had previous experiences with very basic coding in Python and using the Pygame Zero sublibrary for HIP class in 9th grade but I do not remember much at all of it anymore. 

## My Goals for this Course
- Understand coding and how to code in an efficient and effective way
- Become proficient in a coding language 
- Learn how to use GitHub well 

## The Best Thing I Ate this Summer and Where I Ate it
One of the best things I ate this summer was Korean food at a restaurant while visiting my cousins in Illinois.
