### Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
Yes provided that my commit messages are comprehensive and descriptive. It also may help if the various changes made with each commit are of the same type or category (e.g. adding headings or editing grammar).
  
### How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
My first few commit messages accurately and clearly describe what changes were made. The latter commit messages are less descripitve and effective, communicating only that formatting changes were made without specfication of the change or where they were made. 

### How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
I might embed this process in certain projects where progress documentation is necessary or in my 3D CAD models when branching and creating new versions of workspaces.
